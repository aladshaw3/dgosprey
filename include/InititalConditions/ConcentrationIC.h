 *	\brief Initial Condition kernel for initial concentration of a species in a fixed-bed column
 *	\details This file creates an initial condition for the concentration of a species in the bed. The initial condition for
 *			concentration is assumed a constant value at all points in the bed. However, this can be modified later to include
 *			varying initial conditions.
 *
 *	\note If you want to have spatially varying initial conditions, you will need to modify the virtual value function of
 *		this kernel. Otherwise, it is assumed that the non-linear variable is initially constant at all points in the domain.
