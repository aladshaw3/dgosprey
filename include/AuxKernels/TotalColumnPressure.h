 *	\brief Auxillary kernel to calculate total column pressure based on temperature and concentrations
 *	\details This file is responsible for calculating the total column pressure in a fixed-bed adsorber
 *			given the temperature and the concentrations of all species in the gas phase. The gas phase
 *			is assumed to behave ideally and ideal gas law is employed to estimate the pressure.
