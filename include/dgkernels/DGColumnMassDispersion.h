 *	\brief Discontinous Galerkin kernel for mass dispersion in a fixed-bed column
 *	\details This file creates a discontinous Galerkin kernel for the dispersive mass transfer in a fixed-bed column.
 *			The dispersion portion of the mass transport equations involves the molecular diffusivity of a species in the system,
 *			as well as the overall axial dispersion of material caused by mechanical mixing and molecular diffusion. Those
 *			parameters are calculated in a material properties file and passed into this object for use the construction
 *			of residuals and Jacobians.
 *
 *	\note Any DG kernel under DGOSPREY will have a cooresponding G kernel (usually of same name) that must be included
 *		with the DG kernel in the input file. This is because the DG finite element method breaks into several different
 *		residual pieces, only a handful of which are handled by the DG kernel system and the other parts must be handled
 *		by the standard Galerkin system. This my be due to some legacy code in MOOSE. I am not sure if it is possible to
 *		lump all of these actions into a single DG kernel.
