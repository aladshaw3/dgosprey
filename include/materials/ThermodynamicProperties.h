 *	\brief Material Properties kernel that will setup and hold all information associated with equilibria simulations
 *	\details This file creates a material property object for the MAGPIE data structure and associated constants.
 *			That information is used in conjunction with the MAGPIE simulation functions (see magpie.h) in order
 *			to approximate the adsorption capacities and adsorbed amounts of each gas species in a given system
 *			for a given adsorbent.
