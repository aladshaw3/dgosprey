 *	\brief Material Properties kernel that will setup and hold all information associated with the fixed-bed
 *	\details This file creates a material property object for various properties of the fixed bed. Those properties
 *			are used in conjunction with other kernels and materials to establish information such as heat transfer
 *			coefficients, conductivities, and size parameters.
 *
 *
 *	\warning THIS KERNEL IS INCOMPLETE! ONLY USED FOR DATA STORAGE FOR VARIOUS BED PARAMETERS!

 *             of Technology by Austin Ladshaw for PhD research in the area
 *             of adsorption and surface science and was developed for use
