 *	\brief Material Properties kernel that will setup and calculate gas flow properties based on physical characteristics
 *	\details This file creates a material property object for the flow properties in the fixed-bed column. The flow properties
 *			are calculated based on some dimensional analysis, empirical relationships, and kinetic theory of gases. Those
 *			properties are then coupled the with mass and energy kernels in the domain to simulate the dynamic and non-linear
 *			behavior in the system.
