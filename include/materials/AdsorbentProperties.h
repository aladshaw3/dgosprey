 *	\brief Material Properties kernel that will setup and hold all information associated with the adsorbent
 *	\details This file creates a material property object for various properties of a given adsorbent. These
 *			properties are then used in other material property files and/or kernels to calculate information
 *			such as linear velocity, mechanical dispersion, or any adsorption kinetic parameters. 
 *
 *	\note Currently, we do not couple with adsorption kinetics, so this file is only used in conjunction with
 *		the linear velocity and mechanical dispersion properties.
 *
 *	\warning THIS KERNEL IS INCOMPLETE! ONLY USED FOR DATA STORAGE FOR PELLET DENSITY AND HEAT CAPACITY!

 *             of Technology by Austin Ladshaw for PhD research in the area
