 *	\brief Utilities kernel to provide a simpler user interface through yaml input files
 *	\details This file is responsible for providing users with a very simple, optional
 *				user interface that utilizes the yaml file structure. It is coupled with
 *				other data base files, stored in the project directory, that holds parameter
 *				information for common systems that the user may wish to model. The intent
 *				is to give an easier way for the uneducated user to be capable of utilizing
 *				this software without any advanced understanding or manual. 
 *
 *				The simple user interface will read input from a yaml (.yml) file and then
 *				read in the necessary data base information to create a standard MOOSE
 *				input file (.i) that the DGOSPREY program will run. As such, this interface
 *				will have significantly less control over the options that the lower level
 *				interface will have.
