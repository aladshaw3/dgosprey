 *	\brief Utilities kernel to perform serial loading and storing of custom data structures and classes
 *	\details This file is responsible for defining the functions that are used by MOOSE to Store and Load
 *				custom user information used in the MOOSE system. Storing and Loading of data is used in 
 *				MOOSE as part of the restart and multiapps functionality. Any custom user objects that are
 *				defined or used in MOOSE are now required to have specialized dataStore and dataLoad sub-
 *				routines, regardless of whether or not these features are actually used by the code.
 *
 *	\warning PLEASE NOTE: These functions are currently left blank just to appease the compiler gods. You
 *				cannot use restarts or multiapps until these functions are properly filled in.
