 *	\brief Standard kernel for the transfer of heat from the column wall to the ambient air
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for the transfer of energy as heat between the
 *			walls of the column and the ambient air or some radient outer heat source/sink. The heat 
 *			transfer is based on the thickness of the wall and a bed-wall heat transfer coefficient.
 *			It is coupled to the ambient heat and is a primary kernel used in determining
 *			the heat of the wall.
