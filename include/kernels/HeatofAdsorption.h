 *	\brief Kernel for calculation of heat of adsorption based on Thermodynamic Properties and Solid Concentration
 *	\details This file creates a kernel for calculating the heat of adsorption as a non-linear forcing function of
 *				the thermodynamic properties and the solid concentration. It inherits from the CoupledLinearForcingFunction
 *				kernel and overrides its computeQpResidual and computeQpJacobian functions. Input parameters include
 *				the species index and the coupled solid concentration.
 *
 *				Mathematical Description: heat_i = solid_i * isostericheat_i     where isostericheat_i is a parameter
 *				calculated from the thermodynamic properties.
