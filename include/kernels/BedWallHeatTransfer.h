 *	\brief Standard kernel for the transfer of heat from the fixed-bed to the column wall
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for the transfer of energy as heat between the 
 *			bulk gas temperature of the fixed-bed and the temperature of the walls of the column. The 
 *			heat transfer is based on the thickness of the wall and a bed-wall heat transfer coefficient. 
 *			It is coupled to the heat of the gas in the column and is a primary kernel used in determining
 *			the heat of the wall.
