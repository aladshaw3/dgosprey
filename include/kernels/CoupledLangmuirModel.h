 *	\brief Standard kernel for coupling non-linear variables via a langmuir model
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for the coupling of non-linear variables
 *			together via a langmuir forcing function, i.e., variable = b * K * coupled_variable / 1 + K * coupled_variable.
 *			In this kernel, the Langmuir parameter (K) is a function of the non-linear variable temperature through
 *			the van't Hoff expression: ln(K) = -dH/(R*T) + dS/R

 *             of Technology by Alexander Wiechert for PhD research in the area
 *             of adsorption and surface science and was developed for use
 *			   by Idaho National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory
