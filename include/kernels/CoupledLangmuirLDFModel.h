 *	\brief Standard kernel for coupling non-linear variables via the langmuir model with LDF kinetics
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for the coupling of non-linear variables
 *			together via the langmuir model, and applies linear driving force kinetics for the rate
 *			of adsorption.
 *
 *			This kernel extends the CoupledLangmuirModel kernel by calculating the model parameters from
 *			information in the input file for enthalpy and entropy. In addition, it calculates the Linear Driving Force
 *			parameter by estimating the overall LDF rate coefficient from material properties.
 *			The langmuir parameter (K) (described below) are to be estimated from the site enthalpies (dH)
 *			and entropies (dS) using the van't Hoff expression (shown below). Thus, this model
 *			is inherently a function of temperature and will require a different form of coupling
 *			with the temperature parameter.
 *
 *			In addition, the linear driving force parameter (k) is estimated using the Resistance-in-Series
 *			model, which couples film mass transfer (kf), pore diffusion (Dp), and surface diffusion (Dc)
 *			into a single lumped rate parameter (k). Those parameters all come from material properties
 *			files in the DGOSPREY framework.
 *
 *			Resistance-in-series: k = 1/(rhop*q*rp/(3*kf*C)) + (1/((rhop*q*rp*rp/(15*ep*Dp)) + (rc*rc/(15*Dc)))
 *			where rhop is the particle density, q is the adsorption, rp is the particle radius, kf is the film
 *			mass transfer parameter, C is the concentration in the gas phase, ep is the particle porosity,
 *			Dp is the pore diffusion parameter, rc is the adsorbent crystal radius, and Dc is the surface
 *			diffusion parameter.
 *
 *			van't Hoff: ln(K) = -dH/(R*T) + dS/R
 *			where R is the gas law constant and T is the column temperature.
 *
 *			Langmuir isotherm: q = q_max * (K*c)/(1+(K*c))
