 *	\brief Standard kernel for coupling non-linear variables via the GSTA isotherm model
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for the coupling of non-linear variables
 *			together via the GSTA isotherm model.
 *
 *			GSTA isotherm: q = (q_max / m) * SUM(n*Kno*(p/Po)^n)/(1+SUM(Kno*(p/Po)^n))
 *			where q is amount adsorbed, q_max is the maximum capacity, m is the number of adsorption sites
 *			and Kno are the dimensionless equilibrium parameters. Also, p is partial pressure of gas and Po
 *			is taken as a reference state pressure (100 kPa).
 *
 *	\note	For the use of this kernel, our coupled variable with be a gas concentration in mol/L (C), therefore, 
 *			we need to use ideal gas law to rewrite the GSTA model in terms of C as opposed to p. Thus, we are also
 *			forced to couple with kernel with column temperature.
 *
 *			Ideal Gas Law: p = C*R*T
