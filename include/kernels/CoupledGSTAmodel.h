 *	\brief Standard kernel for coupling non-linear variables via the GSTA model
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for the coupling of non-linear variables
 *			together via the GSTA model, which includes estimating model parameters from material
 *			properties files. The primary difference between this kernel and the CoupledGSTAisotherm
 *			kernel is the coupling of the material properties. 
 *
 *			This kernel extends the CoupledGSTAisotherm kernel by calculating the model parameters from
 *			information in the ThermodynamicProperties material. The Kno parameters (described below) are
 *			to be estimated from the site enthalpies (dHno) and entropies (dSno) using the van't Hoff 
 *			expression (shown below). Thus, this model is inherently a function of temperature and will
 *			require a different form of coupling with the temperature parameter. 
 *
 *			van't Hoff: ln(Kno) = -dHno/(R*T) + dSno/R
 *			where R is the gas law constant and T is the column temperature.
 *
 *			GSTA isotherm: q = (q_max / m) * SUM(n*Kno*(p/Po)^n)/(1+SUM(Kno*(p/Po)^n))
 *			where q is amount adsorbed, q_max is the maximum capacity, m is the number of adsorption sites
 *			and Kno are the dimensionless equilibrium parameters. Also, p is partial pressure of gas and Po
 *			is taken as a reference state pressure (100 kPa).
 *
 *	\note	For the use of this kernel, our coupled variable with be a gas concentration in mol/L (C), therefore,
 *			we need to use ideal gas law to rewrite the GSTA model in terms of C as opposed to p. Thus, we are also
 *			forced to couple with kernel with column temperature.
 *
 *			Ideal Gas Law: p = C*R*T
