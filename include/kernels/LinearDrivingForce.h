 *	\brief Standard kernel for a generic coupled linear driving force mechanism
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for a linear driving force type of mechanism that
 *			can be added to the non-linear residuals. It contains a boolean argument to determine whether
 *			the driving force is gaining or losing, a coefficient for the rate of the driving force, and
 *			a driving value to where the non-linear coupled variable is heading towards.
