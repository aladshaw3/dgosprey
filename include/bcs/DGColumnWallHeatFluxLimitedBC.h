 *	\brief Boundary Condition kernel for a dirichlet-like boundary condition of heat on the column wall
 *	\details This file creates a boundary condition that mimics a Dirichlet boundary condition for the
 *			heat of the column at the wall. A true Dirichlet boundary condition does not exist in DG
 *			methods. However, this will create a weak form that imposes a constraint that the solution
 *			must be of a certain value at the boundary.
