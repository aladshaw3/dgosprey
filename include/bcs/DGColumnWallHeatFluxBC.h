 *	\brief Boundary Condition kernel for the heat flux across the wall of the fixed-bed column
 *	\details This file creates a boundary condition kernel for the heat flux across the boundary of
 *			the walls of the column in the fixed-bed adsorber. It inherits from the DGFluxBC, which
 *			acts as a generic flux BC module. This kernel is coupled to the wall temperature variable,
 *			as well as the material properties for thermal conductivity and the bed-wall heat transfer
 *			coefficient.
 *
 *			This type of boundary condition for DG kernels applies the true flux boundary condition.
 *			Alternatively, you can use the "FluxLimitedBC" to impose a Dirichlet boundary condition
 *			on the system. Although, in true finite volumes or DG methods, there is no Dirichlet
 *			boundary conditions, because the solutions are based on fluxes into and out of cells in
 *			a domain.
