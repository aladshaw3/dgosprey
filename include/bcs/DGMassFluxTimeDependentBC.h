 *	\brief Boundary Condition kernel for time dependent mass flux in and out of the ends of the fixed-bed column
 *	\details This file creates a boundary condition kernel for the time dependent mass flux across the boundary of
 *			the ends of the column in the fixed-bed adsorber. It inherits from the DGMassFluxBC, which
 *			is coupled to the column temperature variable, as well as the material properties for
 *          thermal conductivity, gas density and heat capacity, and the velocity in the domain.
 *
 *			This type of boundary condition for DG kernels applies the true flux boundary condition.
 *			Alternatively, you can use the "FluxLimitedBC" to impose a Dirichlet boundary condition
 *			on the system. Although, in true finite volumes or DG methods, there is no Dirichlet
 *			boundary conditions, because the solutions are based on fluxes into and out of cells in
 *			a domain.
