 *	\brief Boundary Condition kernel to mimic a dirichlet boundary condition at the column inlet
 *	\details This file creates a dirichlet-like boundary condition kernel for the gas species concentration
 *			at the inlet of the system. The outlet boundary condition would remain unchanged from the
 *			standard DG form of the boundaries. Only the inlet BC is affected by this file. See
 *			FluxLimitedBC.h for more details.
