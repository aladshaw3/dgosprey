 *	\brief Standard kernel for a coupled linear driving force mechanism
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for a coupled linear driving force mechanism that
 *			can be added to the non-linear residuals. It contains all the same parameters as the more
 *			generic base class, but couples with another non-linear variable via a linear relationship.
 *			The linear coefficient for that relationship is added as an additional parameter to be
 *			set by the user.
