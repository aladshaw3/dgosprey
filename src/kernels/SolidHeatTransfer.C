 *	\brief Standard kernel for the transfer of heat via adsorption
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel for the transfer of heat between the
 *			bulk gas of the fixed-bed and the adsorbent material in the column. The
 *			heat transfer is based on the amount of material in the bed and the heat of adsorption variables.
